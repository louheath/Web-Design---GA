<h2><em>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>
	<p>The two webistes I was most inspired by were <a href="http://siberia.io/">Siberia.io</a> and <a href="http://violaineetjeremy.fr/">violaineetjeremy.fr</a>.

<h2><em>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</em></h2>
	<p><strong>Siberia</strong><br>
		The opening page of this site creates a strong focal point on the work "Siberia." using a lot of negative space surrounding it.  The lack of other information causes you to want to explore and scroll, or you can click the menu, both of which bring you to the same places on the page. The large amounts of negative space surrounding the headings really adds impact to what they say.</p>
	<p><strong>Violane & Jeremy</strong><br>
		This site is a grid based site with even focal points on each peice of work exhibited.  This is effective because it is a portfolio and each is as important.  The site is direct and to the point.</p>

<h2><em>What makes them similar and different?</em></h2>
	<p>These 2 sites are very different in layout but both unconventional which appeals to me.  Siberia is all about scrolling wheras Violane & Jeremy has none.  Both are to the point and have catchy subtitles and headings, which I like.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>duque front page</strong><br>
		 	<img src="duquefrontpage.jpg" alt="duque front page" height="500" width="500">
		 	<p>This layout has a more spread out focal point on the 3 columns on the front page.  This is to be able to present more information right away to the reader.  All 3 columns are the same size and placement to show that they are all equally important in hierarchy.</p>
		 <li><strong>duque front page 2</strong><br>
		 	<img src="duquefrontpage2.jpg" alt="duque front page 2" height="500" width="500">
		 	<p>This layout has a stong focal point on a large image on the front page.  This image can be periodically changed to what is most important to convey to the client at that time.  For example, for salon websites a high fashion photo with great hair really attracts the client, and helps to convey a general vibe of the salon.  During times of special events this can be changed out to a graphic on the event or sale, or for more complexity, a slide show to convey both.  It has one large focal point that is most important.</p>
