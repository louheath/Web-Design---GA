<h2><em>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>
	<p>The two webistes I was most inspired by were <a href="http://siberia.io/">Siberia.io</a> and <a href="http://violaineetjeremy.fr/">violaineetjeremy.fr</a>.

<h2><em>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</em></h2>
	<p><strong>Siberia</strong><br>
		The opening page of this site creates a strong focal point on the work "Siberia." using a lot of negative space surrounding it.  The lack of other information causes you to want to explore and scroll, or you can click the menu, both of which bring you to the same places on the page. The large amounts of negative space surrounding the headings really adds impact to what they say.</p>
	<p><strong>Violane & Jeremy</strong><br>
		This site is a grid based site with even focal points on each peice of work exhibited.  This is effective because it is a portfolio and each is as important.  The site is direct and to the point.</p>

<h2><em>What makes them similar and different?</em></h2>
	<p>These 2 sites are very different in layout but both unconventional which appeals to me.  Siberia is all about scrolling wheras Violane & Jeremy has none.  Both are to the point and have catchy subtitles and headings, which I like.</p>
